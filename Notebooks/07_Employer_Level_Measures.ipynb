    "1. Different measures of stable employment\n",
    "1. Labor market interactions\n",

    "These two sections will have two different units of analysis: the first will focus directly on the individuals in our cohort, and then will switch onto their employers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start looking at their employers, a logical prelude would be taking a deeper dive into our cohort's employment. Here, we will walk through two different measures of stable employment within a cohort and see if their earnings differed significantly from those without stable employment. From there, we will load in our employer-level measures file and look at the differences in employers of members in our cohort who experienced different levels in employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to find out if there are any distinguishing factors between the overall labor market in Indiana and the employers that hired members of our 2016Q4 cohort. Ultimately, we want to gain a better understanding of the demand side when it comes to employment opportunities for our TANF leavers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the [Data Exploration](Data_Exploration.ipynb) notebook, we will pose a few direct questions we will use to answer our ultimate question: **How can we use labor market interactions to help explain employment outcomes of TANF leavers?**\n",
