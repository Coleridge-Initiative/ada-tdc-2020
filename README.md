# TDC's 2020 Applied Data Analytics training program

The goal of the [TANF Data Collaborative](https://www.tanfdata.org/)â€™s Applied Data Analytics program is to help professionals at TANF and related human services agencies develop key data science skills by working hands on with confidential, administrative datasets. The curriculum is designed to introduce the data science skills necessary to work with confidential data.  It provides a mix of online materials that participants can review at their own pace, interactive lectures, prepared materials provided using Jupyter Notebooks and guided project work in small groups. The curriculum draws on the second edition of Big Data and Social Science: A Practical Guide to Methods and Tools, which is available online https://textbook.coleridgeinitiative.org/

## Projects
Participants in this program were grouped into teams of 5 or fewer and created projects in hopes of understanding the relationship between the labor market faced by TANF recipients and their earnings and employment outcomes. Some project questions teams addressed were:

  - What are the characteristics of individuals who do not return to TANF within six months after their initial departure?
  - How can TANF and employment outcomes from the Great Recession help make the program an effective safety during COVID-19?
  - Can factors such as race, gender, and education level help describe the interactions between TANF use and labor market engagement?
  - What are the characteristics of Indiana TANF recipients that are associated with high average quarterly earnings?
